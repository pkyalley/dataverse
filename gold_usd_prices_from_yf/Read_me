Since I use Python for data collection and analysis, I plan to scrape historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for Gold/USD from Yahoo Finance. 
My goal is to gather this data from January 2023 to December 2024 and save it as an Excel file for easy reference and analysis. 
To achieve this, I will use the yfinance library to fetch the data and pandas to process and store it in the desired format. 

By automating this process, I can efficiently track gold price trends over time, making it useful for financial insights and potential trading strategies. 

Let me know if I should refine the approach or add specific features!
