COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed a cleaned COVID-19 dataset using Python, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends over time. Key tasks included data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. I also built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize trends and insights. The final dataset was exported as an Excel report for further analysis. ðŸš€

To run "dashboard.py"
Open a terminal in any code editor (Example: VS Code or PyCharm).
Navigate to the directory where the dashboard.py file is located. For example: cd d:\mystuff\aaa\covd_19_data_analysis
Run the following command: streamlit run dashboard.py
